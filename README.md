# Android support in Bazel

## Overview

This repository contains the Skylark implementation of Android rules in Bazel.

The rules are being incrementally converted from their native implementations
in the [Bazel source
tree](https://source.bazel.build/bazel/+/master:src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/rules/android/).

For the list of Android rules, see the Bazel [documentation](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/android.html).
